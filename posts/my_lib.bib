	title = {Bayesian {Model} {Averaging} in the {M}-{Open} {Framework}},
	isbn = {978-0-19-164700-0},
	abstract = {Consideration of multiple models is routine statistical practice. With computational advances over the past decade, there has been
increased interest in methods for making inferences based on
combining models. Examples include boosting, bagging, stacking, and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), which often lead to improved
performance over methods based on selecting a single model.
Bernardo and Smith have described three Bayesian frameworks for
model selection known as the M-closed, M-complete, and M-open
perspectives. The standard formulation of Bayesian Model Averaging arises as an optimal solution for combining models in the M-closed perspective where one believes that the ``true'' model is included in the list of models under consideration. In the M-complete and
M-open perspectives the ``true'' model is outside the space of
models to be combined, so that model averaging using posterior model probabilities is no longer applicable. Using a decision theoretic approach, we present optimal Bayesian solutions for combining models in these frameworks. We illustrate the methodology with an example of combining models representing two distinct classes, prospective classification trees and retrospective multivariate discriminant
models applied to gene expression data from advanced stage serous ovarian cancers. The goals of this analysis are two-fold:
identifying molecular tumor characteristics associated with
prognosis and determining if long-term survival can be predicted by features intrinsic to the molecular biology of the tumor.},

	abstract = {"Preface This book is intended to have three roles and to serve three associated audiences: an introductory text on Bayesian inference starting from first principles, a graduate text on effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields, and a handbook of Bayesian methods in applied statistics for general users of and researchers in applied statistics. Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

	abstract = {When evaluating and comparing models using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV), the uncertainty of the estimate is typically assessed using the variance of the sampling distribution. Considering the uncertainty is important, as the variability of the estimate can be high in some cases. An important result by Bengio and Grandvalet (2004) states that no general unbiased variance estimator can be constructed, that would apply for any utility or loss measure and any model. We show that it is possible to construct an unbiased estimator considering a specific predictive performance measure and model. We demonstrate an unbiased sampling distribution variance estimator for the Bayesian normal model with fixed model variance using the expected log pointwise predictive density (elpd) utility score. This example demonstrates that it is possible to obtain improved, problem-specific, unbiased estimators for assessing the uncertainty in LOO-CV estimation.},

	abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) is a popular method for comparing Bayesian models based on their estimated predictive performance on new, unseen, data. As leave-one-out cross-validation is based on finite observed data, there is uncertainty about the expected predictive performance on new data. By modeling this uncertainty when comparing two models, we can compute the probability that one model has a better predictive performance than the other. Modeling this uncertainty well is not trivial, and for example, it is known that the commonly used standard error estimate is often too small. We study the properties of the Bayesian LOO-CV estimator and the related uncertainty estimates when comparing two models. We provide new results of the properties both theoretically in the linear regression case and empirically for multiple different models and discuss the challenges of modeling the uncertainty. We show that problematic cases include: comparing models with similar predictions, misspecified models, and small data. In these cases, there is a weak connection in the skewness of the individual leave-one-out terms and the distribution of the error of the Bayesian LOO-CV estimator. We show that it is possible that the problematic skewness of the error distribution, which occurs when the models make similar predictions, does not fade away when the data size grows to infinity in certain situations. Based on the results, we also provide practical recommendations for the users of Bayesian LOO-CV for model comparison.},

	abstract = {Bayesian model comparison is often based on the posterior distribution over the set of compared models. This distribution is often observed to concentrate on a single model even when other measures of model fit or forecasting ability indicate no strong preference. Furthermore, a moderate change in the data sample can easily shift the posterior model probabilities to concentrate on another model. We document overconfidence in two high-profile applications in economics and neuroscience. To shed more light on the sources of overconfidence we derive the sampling variance of the Bayes factor in univariate and multivariate linear regression. The results show that overconfidence is likely to happen when i) the compared models give very different approximations of the data-generating process, ii) the models are very flexible with large degrees of freedom that are not shared between the models, and iii) the models underestimate the true variability in the data.},

This article discusses exchangeability as the foundation for Bayesian econometrics. It serves as the basis for further extensions to incorporate heterogeneity and dependency across observations. It also discusses representation theorems involving random variables more complicated than Bernoulli random variables.

              We propose local prediction pools as a method for combining the predictive distributions of a set of experts conditional on a set of variables believed to be related to the predictive accuracy of the experts. This is done in a two‐step process where we first estimate the conditional predictive accuracy of each expert given a vector of covariates—or pooling variables—and then combine the predictive distributions of the experts conditional on this local predictive accuracy. To estimate the local predictive accuracy of each expert, we introduce the simple, fast, and interpretable
              caliper method
              . Expert pooling weights from the local prediction pool approaches the equal weight solution whenever there is little data on local predictive performance, making the pools robust and adaptive. We also propose a local version of the widely used optimal prediction pools. Local prediction pools are shown to outperform the widely used optimal linear pools in a macroeconomic forecasting evaluation and in predicting daily bike usage for a bike rental company.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},
